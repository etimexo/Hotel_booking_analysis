# Hotel_booking_analysis
## üìå Project Overview

This project analyzes hotel booking data to uncover insights related to booking requests, pricing, room types, and customer preferences. The goal is to identify patterns that can help optimize pricing strategies and improve customer experience.

üìä Dataset Description

The dataset contains information about hotel bookings, including:
1. Booking requests and special requests
2. Room types and their prices
3. Monthly booking trends
4. Special requests and their impact on pricing

##üõ† Data Processing

Data Cleaning: There wasn't much to do here as the dataset was from Kaggle. But what I did do was to create another column named "arrival_month_abc".
This was because the original months in the data were numeric and I needed their alphabetic representations for visualization.

Feature Engineering: Created additional features like month-wise analysis.

Visualization: Used charts and graphs to explore trends.
